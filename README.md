# Fossil Excavation Simulation using DFS
This project is a simulation of a Fossil Excavation process using Depth-First Search (DFS) for exploration. The grid-based excavation environment includes real fossils, false fossils, and obstacles randomly distributed. The goal is to navigate through the excavation site and uncover real fossils while avoiding obstacles.

Features:
1. Random Grid Generation: Creates a 10x10 excavation grid with fossils, false fossils, and obstacles.
2. DFS-Based Exploration: Uses DFS to traverse the grid and locate fossils.
3. Tkinter Input Dialog: Allows user input for the number of fossils and false fossils.
4. Visualization with Pygame: Displays excavation progress with color-coded tiles:
5. Red: Real Fossil
6. Blue: False Fossil
7. Yellow: Visited Path
8. Black: Obstacle
9. White: Unexplored Area
10. Orange: Current Path
11. Pop-Up Summary: Shows excavation results using Tkinter message box.

Technologies Used:
1. Python
2. Pygame (for visualization)
3. Tkinter (for user interaction)
4. Random Library (for grid generation)
